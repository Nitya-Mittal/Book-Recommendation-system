# Book-Recommendation-system
This Book Recommendation System was developed using Machine Learning techniques, including Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Recommendation models. We implemented Weighted Rating Scores, Correlation-Based Filtering, and Nearest Neighbors to enhance accuracy. The project utilized Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data processing, model training, and visualization. This system provides personalized book recommendations based on user preferences, ratings, and location-specific trends.
